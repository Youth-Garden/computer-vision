# Session 2: Intermediate Image Processing

This session builds upon the basics to explore intermediate image processing techniques, focusing on enhancing images and extracting useful information through filtering and transformations.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV (cv2)**: Used for advanced image processing algorithms including convolution kernels and geometric transformations.
- **NumPy**: Essential for array manipulation, creating kernels, and handling image matrices.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for visualizing the effects of different filters and transformations side-by-side with original images.

## Contents

- **[Session_2.ipynb](Session_2.ipynb)**: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating various intermediate techniques.
- **[Images](Images)**: A directory containing test images for the exercises.

## Objectives

- **Image Filtering and Smoothing**: Implementing techniques like Gaussian blur, Median blur, and bilateral filtering to reduce noise and detail.
- **Morphological Operations**: Using erosion, dilation, opening, and closing to process binary images and remove imperfections.
- **Geometric Transformations**: Performing operations such as rotation, scaling, translation, and affine transformations to modify the spatial arrangement of pixels.
