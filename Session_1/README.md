# Session 1: Introduction to Image Processing

This session serves as a foundational introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing. It focuses on the basics of handling digital images as data structures and performing elementary operations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for all examples.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It is used here for reading, writing, and manipulating images efficiently.
- **NumPy**: The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Images in OpenCV are represented as NumPy arrays, allowing for powerful matrix operations.
- **Matplotlib**: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Used for displaying images and results inline within the notebook.

## Contents

- **[Session_1.ipynb](Session_1.ipynb)**: The main Jupyter Notebook for this session. It contains step-by-step code examples demonstrating how to load images, access pixel data, and visualize channels.
- **[Images](Images)**: A directory containing sample images used for testing the code in the notebook.

## Objectives

- **Loading and Displaying Images**: Learn how to read images from file paths and display them using matplotlib.
- **Pixel Manipulation**: Understand how to access and modify individual pixels or regions of an image.
- **Image Channels**: Explore the RGB color space and understand how images are composed of multiple channels.
